# Paint 2D

**Paint 2D** is a fun, two-dimensional painting app that runs in your terminal!

Move your paintbrush around with the arrow keys, press <kbd>Space</kbd> to splat some paint down, change up the colour with keys <kbd>1</kbd>&ndash;<kbd>9</kbd>.

## Download

Download the program by viewing the [latest release](https://github.com/RandomSearch18/paint-2d/releases/latest), downloading the `.zip` file that matches your platform (e.g. `Windows x86_64` for 64-bit Windows) and extracting it. Then, simply run the executable file (it may be buried within a folder called `target`).

If you have issues, there is an alternate download link for [Paint 2D v0.1.0 for Windows x86_64.zip](https://ghostfiles.uk/files/8a6aba1fb7643441e196.zip).

## Run

Running the executable file (`paint-2d.exe` or `./paint-2d`) will open a terminal window, from which you can start drawing. You will see an indicator for where your paintbrush is in the top-left corner. The following keyboard actions are available:

- Arrow keys: move the paintbrush around
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys: move the paintbrush _faster!_
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + arrow keys: move the paintbrush ⚡ _even faster!_ ⚡
- <kbd>Space</kbd>: paint a single pixel
- Number keys: change the colour of your paintbrush (available colours are shown at the bottom)
- <kbd>Q</kbd>: quit the program (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> can also be used)
